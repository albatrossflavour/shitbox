# Phase 1 — Validation Strategy

> Generated by `gsd-phase-researcher` during `/gsd:plan-phase 1`.
> Updated by `gsd-plan-checker` after plan approval.
> Governs feedback sampling during `/gsd:execute-phase 1`.

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | pytest 7.x |
| **Config file** | pyproject.toml |
| **Quick run command** | `pytest -x --tb=short` |
| **Full suite command** | `pytest tests/ --tb=short` |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~5 seconds |
| **CI pipeline** | none — local only |

---

## Nyquist Sampling Rate

> The minimum feedback frequency required to reliably catch errors in this phase.

- **After every task commit:** Run `pytest -x --tb=short`
- **After every plan wave:** Run `pytest tests/ --tb=short`
- **Before `/gsd:verify-work`:** Full suite must be green
- **Maximum acceptable task feedback latency:** 10 seconds

## Per-Task Verification Map

| Task ID | Plan | Wave | Requirement | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists | Status |
|---------|------|------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| TBD | TBD | TBD | BOOT-01 | unit | `pytest tests/test_boot_recovery.py -x` | ❌ W0 | ⬜ pending |
| TBD | TBD | TBD | BOOT-02 | unit | `pytest tests/test_boot_recovery.py -x` | ❌ W0 | ⬜ pending |
| TBD | TBD | TBD | BOOT-03 | unit | `pytest tests/test_database.py -x` | ❌ W0 | ⬜ pending |

*Status values: ⬜ pending · ✅ green · ❌ red · ⚠️ flaky*

## Wave 0 Requirements

> Test scaffolding committed BEFORE any implementation task. Executor runs Wave 0 first.

- [ ] `tests/test_boot_recovery.py` — stubs for BOOT-01, BOOT-02
- [ ] `tests/test_database.py` — stubs for BOOT-03 (synchronous=FULL)
- [ ] `tests/conftest.py` — shared fixtures (if not existing)

---

## Manual-Only Verifications

> Behaviors that genuinely cannot be automated, with justification.
> These are surfaced during `/gsd:verify-work` UAT.

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| System boots cleanly after hard power cut | BOOT-01 | Physical device, requires actual power interruption | Pull power mid-run on Pi, verify clean restart and log output |
| OLED shows recovery status until GPS fix | BOOT-01 | Physical OLED display verification | Observe OLED after crash recovery boot |
| Buzzer pattern differs for clean vs crash boot | BOOT-01 | Physical buzzer output | Listen for single vs double beep pattern |

---

## Validation Sign-Off

Updated by `gsd-plan-checker` when plans are approved:

- [ ] All tasks have `<automated>` verify commands or Wave 0 dependencies
- [ ] No 3 consecutive implementation tasks without automated verify (sampling continuity)
- [ ] Wave 0 test files cover all MISSING references
- [ ] No watch-mode flags in any automated command
- [ ] Feedback latency per task: < 10s ✅
- [ ] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter

**Plan-checker approval:** pending

## Execution Tracking

Updated during `/gsd:execute-phase 1`:

| Wave | Tasks | Tests Run | Pass | Fail | Sampling Status |
|------|-------|-----------|------|------|-----------------|
| 0 | TBD | — | — | — | scaffold |
| 1 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | ⬜ pending |

**Phase validation complete:** pending
